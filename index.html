							<h2>"Early Life"</h2>
							<p>I went to preschool and it is called Paseo Baptist Learning Center, but now it is named something different. I am currently 15-years old and I am in the 10th grade and I have been going to University Academy since Kindergarten. I have always been good at school and when I didn't understand smoething I always asked questions or stayed for tutoring. I have alwasy really been involved with school from after school activities to field trips really. I started getting into sports when I was in the 7th grade and that sport which is my favorite, is volleyball and I have never stopped playing until this year due to Covid. I played basketball last year when I was in 9th grade for the first time and even though I didn't like it I still played the whole season. I was in debate in middle school but I stopped because the debate teacher that we had, Mr. Jouya had left and I didn't have the motivation to keep doing debate when he had left. I have had 6 dogs so far, 2 died unfortunately, but 1 dog is a Maltese Terrior and the other 5 are Pits. I like to many things and I'm good at doing them so I guess you can say I have many talents. I like to draw, write, color, do nails, do hair, make clothes, play volleyball, collect shoes, play video games, watch movies, and eat.</p>

							<h2>Goals</h2>
							<p>I have wanted to do at least four different things when I get over as the years go by, but I can't make up my mind yet since I liked doing all four of those things. When I started doing debate I wanted either be a lawyer or a prosecuter but my mind changed after my debate teacher left the school. I have always been good at math so I wanted to work with finances but I don't really know wbaout that anymore because with all these adjustments to the new way of learning and plus we had gotten a new math teacher this year, it's like I don't even know what I'm doing anymore when it comes to math. Ever since I played volleyball I had always wanted to play volleyball in college for Nebraska if my other plans didn't work out so if I still want to do so I really need to hit the gym because my last 2 years of highschool is coming up pretty fast. My final thing that I wanted to do was start my own business with someone I could trust and someone who did the same things as me which is doing hair and nails. Over quarantine I started learning new things especially from TikTok and my nana really started me up to doing nails because she had bought me everything that I needed for it. I started doing my own hair and playing in eveyrone else hair for years but I started doing braids this year since I was always inside the house and I never knew I was good at it until I kept practicing.</p>

						<h2>Colleges/ Career</h2>
						<p>Of course if I plan on playing volleyball I would want to go to Nebraska University for college and if I dont I would want to go to an HBCU college. Ever since we learned about HBCU colleges I was amazed. I would also want to be ina sorority if I do go. And like I said above I would like to do something with hair and nails so I would go to a Cosmetology school to learn more about things like that. I wouldn't want to do anything that would bore me and I feel that my choices for my future aren't boring at all to me and that's all that really matters because I wouldn't want to be doing something in my life that I wouldn't get to have fun and be involved at the same time while doing.</p>

						<h2>How has Covid-19 benefitted me?</h2>
						<p>During quarantine I have learned things that I probably wouldn't have learned until it was too late. I've been watching different YouTube videos and TikTok's about doing nails, hair, and things that I use everyday or occasionally about different items. My mother and I especially have tought each other things and learned from one another and if we never had quarantine I probably wouldn't have the relationship I have with her now than what I did before. I have learned different things about my curl pattern too which is fun because now I don't just wear my hair in ponytails I can wear it in protective styles like twist-outs, braid-out and I can even do wash-and-go's. Even though it may sound wrong but I'm kind of glad we have exxperienced a pandemic because it's like a break from everyone and sometimes everyone needs a break from people because people can cause stress and I am too young to be stressed out. I also get to be apart of history and tell kids after me everything that had went down. </p>
